# wp-bookmark
Click a bookmark on any web page to send that page's title, description, and open graph image to your new post page. It's like the old "Press This." But, it works with the new editor.

## Installation & How to use
- Download the zip file
- Upload and activate
- Go to Tools -> Bookmarklet
- Copy the code and paste the code as a new bookmark's URL
- Go to a webpage, click the new bookmark

## To do
- The open graph image (if one exists) is added to the post content, but not set as the Featured Image. I would like to make that work one day. Or, perhaps you know how and can submit a pull request.
